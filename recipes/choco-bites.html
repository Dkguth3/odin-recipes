<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>     Admittedly, I used to hate the taste of dates when I was younger.
I tried to avoid eating it whenever it was on the table.
However, as I got older, I started to appreciate its extremely sweet taste.</p>

<p> After reading some recipes on vegan brownie bites, I instantly thought of dates.
Its sweetness allows it to be used as a healthier sweetener in cooking. </p>

<p>I wanted to make this recipe for my father since he is a diabetic. 
This no-bake recipe creates a snack that is quick, delicious, and healthy.</p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup of pitted dates</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of blanched almonds</li>
    <li>3 tbsp of cacao powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>small pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Use a food processor to blend all the ingredients</li>
    <li>Form the mixture into a ball and refrigerate for about half an hour</li>
    <li>Take it out and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
