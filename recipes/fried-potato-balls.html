<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>    I’ve been to a few restaurants where they served fried potato balls and I’ve always loved them so much. If I recall, they ranged from 50 cents to a dollar each. The batch I made was about 30 something balls and I didn’t even pay a dime. </p>
    
<p>    When you make these sort of unhealthy foods, you want to already have these ingredients already at home. It feels less guilty that way. </p>
<p>    My policy is if you are going to eat unhealthy foods, at least make it yourself so you know what kind of oil you fried it in or how much salt you put in your mashed potatoes. Plus, food always tastes better when cooked at home.</p>


<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups of prepared, cold mashed potatoes</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of chopped green onions</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of any cheese of your choice (I used  mozzarella)</li>
    <li>Pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    <li>Panko</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    
</ul>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>To your cold mashed potatoes, add in garlic powder and pepper flakes. Mix with a wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Then, add in the cheese of your choice and chopped green onions by folding it in</li>
    <li>Once everything is incorporated, grab a small scoop of cold mashed potatoes with your hands and roll it into a ball. They should be about 1 inch in diameter. Continue this process until all the mashed potatoes are formed into balls. I recommend washing your hands and drying it every once in awhile because the potatoes do get stuck on your hands which can make the rolling process harder.</li>
    <li>Crack two eggs in a separate bowl and beat them. Grab another bowl for the panko.</li>

    <li>Once you have your bowls ready, grab your mashed potato ball and dip it your beaten eggs. Next, roll it in the bowl of panko. Set aside on a separate dish. Repeat this step until all the balls are coated with egg and panko. Do not throw away the extra egg or panko.</li>
    
    <li>Refrigerate the balls for about 20-30 minutes. Take it out and do the second panko coating. Repeat step 4.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate the balls for another 20-30 minutes</li>
</ol>
<h5><em>Deep-frying:</em></h5>

<ol>
    <li>In a wok or fryer, pour in the oil of your choice to more than 1/2 an inch. You can fill it to 1 inch or more so your ball can be submerged in oil, but I like to fry it halfway and then flip the ball over.</li>
    <li>Since I do not own a thermometer yet, I just heat my oil on medium. When you throw a piece of crumb into the oil, it should start frying which indicates the oil is well-heated. Everyone has their own way of frying, so I will leave it up to you to decide.</li>
    <li>Put in about 6 balls into the fryer. Flip them over when the other side is golden brown and crispy. Continue this process until all the balls are done.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Enjoy these balls with ketchup or hot sauce. I put a tablespoon of guacamole on top of the balls which definitely hit the spot.</h5>
